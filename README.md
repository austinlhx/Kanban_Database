# Kanban_Database
Hi Easy Track,

Here is my code for the Kanban Database. To run the code you will need Python, and JSON. To run the code, begin by inputting any id in the user.json file. Then click login to logon to the platform, after it will say login success, from there close all windows and a database will appear with all tasks. To look at what tasks are available click the plus button which will show the descriptions of the task.

Thank you!
Austin Ho
